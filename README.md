Firmware for the ESP32-based Tranquil kinetic sand drawing robots.

## Requirements

This is *not* a drop-in replacement for Rob Dobson's original RBotFirmware! Many things have been changed/moved around.

Hardware:
- Stepper drivers (preferably TMC2208/2209, generics can be used)
- Endstops
- ESP32, must have at least 4MB flash for proper OTA operation
- SD Card - can either use MMC mode or SPI mode, SPI mode can use any pins, albeit is much slower.

> This project requires an operational [TranquilAPI](https://github.com/acvigue/TranquilAPI) server! Run your own on CloudFlare Workers!

## Notes

The firmware is setup to automatically check for updates from a central server. The firmware binaries are built upon commit to this repository and are automatically uploaded to the OTA server.

See [cloudflare-ota-server](https://github.com/acvigue/cloudflare-ota-server) for more information. 

## Robot Configuration Reference

Robot configuration is stored in NVRAM and can be viewed by sending GET request to `/settings/robot` and can be changed by POSTing JSON to `/settings/robot`

Similarly, wifi/ntp/scheduler/light settings can be changed at

- /settings/wifi < Network settings (supports WPA2-Enterprise)
- /settings/ntp < time zone and ntp server
- /settings/scheduler < stores scheduled commands
- /settings/lights < LED lights
- /settings/security < used to store PIN code
- /settings/tranquil < only used for storing TranquilAPI encrypted JWT

> LED strip _must_ be attached to GPIO5
